    "If you have access to data on an entire population, say the size of every house in Ames, Iowa, it’s straight forward to answer questions like, “How big is the typical house in Ames?” and “How much variation is there in sizes of houses?”. If you have access to only a sample of the population, as is often the case, the task becomes more complicated. What is your best guess for the typical size if you only know the sizes of several dozen houses? This sort of situation requires that you use your sample to make inference on what your population looks like.\n",

Note that the data set has information on many housing variables, but for the first portion of the lab we’ll focus on the size of the house, represented by the variable `GrLivArea`."

Based only on this single sample, the best estimate of the average living area of houses sold in Ames would be the sample mean, usually denoted as $\\bar{x}$ (here we’re calling it `sample_mean`). That serves as a good point estimate but it would be useful to also communicate how uncertain we are of that estimate. This can be captured by using a *confidence interval*.\n",

This is an important inference that we’ve just made: even though we don’t know what the full population looks like, we’re 95% confident that the true average size of houses in Ames lies between the values lower and upper. There are a few conditions that must be met for this interval to be valid.\n",
