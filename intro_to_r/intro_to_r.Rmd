```

The goal of this lab is to introduce you to R and RStudio, which you'll be using
throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the 
texbook and also to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions. To 
straighten out which is which: R is the name of the programming language itself 
and RStudio is a convenient interface.

As the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate;
a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we 
get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we
begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, 
reading in data, and basic commands.

When you first open RStudio, you should see a window that looks like the image shown below.

![](more/r-interface-2016.png)

The panel in the upper right contains your *environment* as well as a history of 
the commands that you've previously entered. Any plots that you generate will 
show up in the panel in the lower right corner.

The panel on the left is where the action happens. It's called the *console*. 
Everytime you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the 
console telling you the version of R that you're running. Below that information
is the *prompt*. As its name suggests, this prompt is really a request, a 
request for a command. Initially, interacting with R is all about typing commands
and interpreting the output. These commands and their syntax have evolved over
decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a fairly natural way
to access data and organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations.

## R Packages

R is an open-source programming language, meaning that users can contribute
packages that make our lives easier and we can use them for free. For this lab,
and many others in the future, we will use the following R packages:

- `oilabs`: short for "OpenIntro Labs"
- `dplyr`: for data wrangling
- `ggplot2`: for data visualization

Please watch [this very short video](to learn how to download and install packages.
Once you have a package, you'll need to load it into your R session to take advantage
of its power. Load these three packages into your session by running the following
lines at the console.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(oilabs)
```

## Creating a reproducible lab report

You will be typing up your lab report in what's called an R Markdown file. This 
allows you to complete your lab entirely in RStudio while ensuring the
reproducibility of your analysis and results. To help get you started we are 
providing a template for you through the `oilabs` package that you just loaded.
To open that file, click on the small green plus icon in the upper left corner
of your screen and select **R Markdown...**. This will bring up this menu:

Fig Here.

Click on **From Template** and select **Lab 1 Template**.

This will open up a lab report in a new pane called the *editor*. To get a sense
of how this document is structured, you can [watch this video]().

Two things to note before we move on to the actual lab. 1) You'll recognize that
the R Markdown file has the same three lines used to load the packages. We need 
to load the packages both in the console and in your R Markdown environment since 
these two environments work independently of each other. 2) At the very top of the
report there is a field for "author". Fill in your name then click the **Knit HTML**
button. Voila - a lab report! As you proceed with the lab and add to this document,
we encourage you to knit often to be sure it's coming along as you intend.

## The Data: Dr. Arbuthnot's Baptism Records

To get you started, run the following command from your markdown file.

```{r load-abrbuthnot-data}
head(arbuthnot)
```

To do so, you can simply put your cursor on that line, and hit the **Run** button
on the upper right corner of the pane.

This command instructs R to print out the first several lines of a data set 
containing baptism counts for boys and girls. You should see that the 
workspace area in the upper righthand corner of the RStudio window now lists a 
data set called `arbuthnot` that has 82 observations on 3 variables. As you 
interact with R, you will create a series of objects. Sometimes you load them as
we have done here, and sometimes you create them yourself as the byproduct of a 
computation or some analysis you have performed.

The Arbuthnot data set refers to Dr. John Arbuthnot, an 18<sup>th</sup> century 
physician, writer, and mathematician. He was interested in the ratio of newborn
boys to newborn girls, so he gathered the baptism records for children born in
London for every year from 1629 to 1710. We can take a look at the entire data set
by typing its name into the console.

```{r view-data}
arbuthnot
```

We can also view the data in a cleaner format using the data viewer. Click on
the name `arbuthnot` in the *Environment* pane (upper right window) that lists 
the objects in your workspace. This will bring up an alternative display of the 
data set in the *Data Viewer* (upper left window). You can close the data viewer
by clicking on the *x* in the upper lefthand corner.

What you should see are four columns of numbers, each row representing a 
different year: the first entry in each row is simply the row number (an index 
we can use to access the data from individual years if we want), the second is 
the year, and the third and fourth are the numbers of boys and girls baptized 
that year, respectively. Use the scrollbar on the right side of the console 
window to examine the complete data set.

Note that the row numbers in the first column are not part of Arbuthnot's data. 
R adds them as part of its printout to help you make visual comparisons. You can
think of them as the index that you see on the left side of a spreadsheet. In 
fact, the comparison to a spreadsheet will generally be helpful. R has stored 
Arbuthnot's data in a kind of spreadsheet or table called a *data frame*.

You can see the dimensions of this data frame by typing:

```{r dim-data}
dim(arbuthnot)
```

This command should output `[1] 82 3`, indicating that there are 82 rows and 3 
columns (we'll get to what the `[1]` means in a bit), just as it says next to 
the object in your workspace. You can see the names of these columns (or 
variables) by typing:

```{r names-data}
names(arbuthnot)
```

You should see that the data frame contains the columns `year`,  `boys`, and 
`girls`. At this point, you might notice that many of the commands in R look a 
lot like functions from math class; that is, invoking R commands means supplying
a function with some number of arguments. The `dim` and `names` commands, for 
example, each took a single argument, the name of a data frame. 

## Some Exploration

Let's start to examine the data a little more closely. We can access the data in
a single column of a data frame separately using a command like

```{r view-boys}
arbuthnot$boys
```

This command will only show the number of boys baptized each year. The dollar
sign basically says "go to the data frame that comes before me, and find the 
variable that comes after me".

1. What command would you use to extract just the counts of girls baptized? Try
    it! (Enter your answer in your R markdown document and run the entire report
    by hitting **Knit HTML**. Voila! The R output you need is already in your 
    report. Let's make this the first and last time we print out an entire dataset
    in a lab report!)
    
Notice that the way R has printed these data is different. When we looked at the
complete data frame, we saw 82 rows, one on each line of the display. These data
are no longer structured in a table with other variables, so they are displayed 
one right after another. Objects that print out in this way are called vectors. 
R has added numbers in [brackets] along the left
side of the printout to indicate locations within the vector. For example, 5218 
follows [1], indicating that 5218 is the first entry in the vector. And if [43] 
starts a line, then that would mean the first number on that line would represent
the 43rd entry in the vector.

R has some powerful functions for making graphics. We can create a simple plot 
of the number of girls baptized per year with the command

```{r plot-girls-vs-year}
qplot(x = year, y = girls, data = arbuthnot)
```

The `qplot()` function (meaning "quick plot") looks at the type of data you have
provided and makes the decision to visualize it with a scatterplot. The plot
should appear under the *Plots* tab of the lower right panel of RStudio. Notice 
that the command above again looks like a function, this time with three arguments
separated by commas. The first two arguments in the `qplot()` function specify 
the variables for the x-axis and the y-axis and the third provides the name of the
data set where they can be found. If we wanted to connect the data points with 
lines, we could add a fourth argument to specify the geometry that we'd like.

```{r plot-girls-vs-year-line}
qplot(x = year, y = girls, data = arbuthnot, geom = "line")
```

You might wonder how you are supposed to know that it was possible to add that 
fourth argument. Thankfully, R documents all of its functions extensively. To 
read what a function does and learn the arguments that are available to you, 
just type in a question mark followed by the name of the function that you're 
interested in. Try the following.

```{r plot-help, tidy = FALSE}
?qplot
```

Notice that the help file replaces the plot in the lower right panel. You can 
toggle between plots and help files using the tabs at the top of that panel.

2. Is there an apparent trend in the number of girls baptized over the years? 
How would you describe it?

Now, suppose we want to plot the total number of baptisms. To compute this, we 
could use the fact that R is really just a big calculator. We can type in 
mathematical expressions like

```{r calc-total-bapt-numbers}
5218 + 4683
```

to see the total number of baptisms in 1629. We could repeat this once for each 
year, but there is a faster way. If we add the vector for baptisms for boys to 
that of girls, R will compute all sums simultaneously.

```{r calc-total-bapt-vars}
arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls
```

What you will see are 82 numbers (in that packed display, because we aren’t 
looking at a data frame here), each one representing the sum we’re after. Take a
look at a few of them and verify that they are right.

We'll be using this new vector to generate some plots, so we'll want to save it 
as a permanent column in our data frame.

```{r calc-total-bapt-vars-save}
arbuthnot <- mutate(arbuthnot, total = boys + girls)
```

We can read this line of code as the following: 

*Mutate the `arbuthnot` data set to create a new variable called `total` that is
the sum of the variables called `boys` and `girls`. Then assign this new 
resulting dataset to the object called `arbuthnot`, i.e. overwrite the old 
`arbuthnot` dataset with the new one containing the new variable.*

This is essentially equivalent to going through each row and adding up the boys 
and girls counts for that year and recording that value in a new column called
total.

<div id="boxedtext">
**Where is the new variable? ** When you make changes to variables in your dataset, 
click on the name of the dataset again to update it in the data viewer.
</div>

You'll see that there is now a new column called `total` that has been tacked on
to the data frame. The special symbol `<-` performs an *assignment*, taking the 
output of one line of code and saving it into an object in your workspace. In 
this case, you already have an object called `arbuthnot`, so this command updates
that data set with the new mutated column.

We can make a plot of the total number of baptisms per year with the command

```{r plot-total-vs-year}
qplot(x = year, y = total, data = arbuthnot, geom = "line")
```

Similarly to how we computed the total number of births, we can compute the ratio 
of the number of boys to the number of girls baptized in 1629 with

```{r calc-prop-boys-to-girls-numbers}
5218 / 4683
```

or we can act on the complete columns with the expression

```{r calc-prop-boys-to-girls-vars}
arbuthnot <- mutate(arbuthnot, boy_to_girl_ratio = boys / girls)
```

We can also compute the proportion of newborns that are boys in 1629

```{r calc-prop-boys-numbers}
5218 / (5218 + 4683)
```

or this may also be computed for all years simultaneously and append it to the dataset:

```{r calc-prop-boys-vars}
arbuthnot <- mutate(arbuthnot, boy_ratio = boys / total)
```

Note that we are using the new `total` variable we created earlier in our calculations.

3. Now, generate a plot of the proportion of boys born over time. What do you see? 

<div id="boxedtext">
**Tip: ** If you use the up and down arrow keys, you can scroll through your 
previous commands, your so-called command history. You can also access it 
by clicking on the history tab in the upper right panel. This will save 
you a lot of typing in the future.
</div>

Finally, in addition to simple mathematical operators like subtraction and 
division, you can ask R to make comparisons like greater than, `>`, less than,
`<`, and equality, `==`. For example, we can ask if boys outnumber girls in each 
year with the expression

```{r boys-more-than-girls}
arbuthnot <- mutate(more_boys = boys > girls)
```

This command add a new variable to the `arbuthnot` dataframe containing the values
of either `TRUE` if that year had more boys than girls, or `FALSE` if that year 
did not (the answer may surprise you). This variable contains different kind of 
data than we have considered so far. All other columns in the `arbuthnot` data 
frame have values are numerical (the year, the number of boys and girls). Here, 
we've asked R to create *logical* data, data where the values are either `TRUE` 
or `FALSE`. In general, data analysis will involve many different kinds of data 
types, and one reason for using R is that it is able to represent and compute 
with many of them.

This seems like a fair bit for your first lab, so let's stop here. Be sure to
save your Rmd so that you can continue your work at a later date.

## On Your Own

<div class="oyo">

In the lab above, you recreated some displays and preliminary 
analysis of Arbuthnot's baptism data. Your assignment involves repeating these 
steps, but for present day birth records in the United States. Glimpse the first
several lines of this data set by typing.

```{r load-present-data}
head(present)
```

The data are stored in a data frame called `present`.

-   What years are included in this data set? What are the dimensions of the 
    data frame? What are the variable (column) names?

-   How do these counts compare to Arbuthnot's? Are they on a similar scale?

-   Make a plot that displays the proportion of boys born over time. What do you see? 
    Does Arbuthnot's observation about boys being born in greater proportion than girls 
    hold up in the U.S.? Include the plot in your response. *Hint:* You should be
    able to reuse your code from Ex 3 above, just replace the dataframe name.

-   In what year did we see the most total number of births in the U.S.? *Hint:*
    First calculate the totals and save it as a new variable. Then, sort your
    dataset in descending order based on the total column. You can do this
    interactively in the data viewer by clicking on the arrows next to the 
    variable names. To include the sorted result in your report you will need 
    to use two new functions: `arrange` (for sorting). We can arrange the data 
    in a descenting order with another function: `descr` (for descending order).
    Sample code provided below.
    
<!-- eval=FALSE hard-coded, 
won't run since present$total not defined in document -->
```{r eval=FALSE}
arrange(present, desc(total))
```

These data come from reports by the Centers for Disease Control listed in the
references section. If you would like to read more about an analysis of sex ratios
at birth in the United states, check out [this report](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_10.pdf).

## Resources for learning R and working in RStudio

That was a short introduction to R and RStudio, but we will provide you with more
functions and a more complete sense of the language as the labs progress. 

In these labs we will be using R packages called `dplyr` for data wrangling 
and `ggplot2` for data visualization. If you are googling for R code, make sure
to also include these package names in your search query. For example, instead
of googling "scatterplot in R", google "scatterplot in R with ggplot2".

These cheatsheets may come in handy throughout the semester:

- [RMarkdown cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
- [Data wrangling cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)
- [Data visualization cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)

Note that some of the code on these cheatsheets may be too advanced for this course,
however majority of it will become useful throughout the semester.
